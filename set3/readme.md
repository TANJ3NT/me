TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Week 3:

# Experience

> The saying in LOTR by Bilbo Baggins, “I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.” is literally me this term. CODE1161 is officially the course that takes up the most time this semester, and while we are still pulling our hair out during CODE1240 and CODE3100, this coding course is killing me slowly.

Actually on second thoughts, its killing me pretty fast.

On the bright side though, it is genuinely interesting to learn new things every week. Not just in coding, but in understanding the thought process behind it and also the culture through the resources.
This week was probably the most time consuming to date. I still feel uncomfortable with a lot of the fundamentals, as it hasn’t clicked with me yet. I don’t have a computer/coding background, and my thought process likes to analyse things that are already there, while generating an original solution from scratch is an approach I have not had much experience with.

# Diagram (attached image)

> We were asked to make a diagram based on the code in Exercise 2 (W3). I made the diagram founded on the general idea of what made sense to me, and how I would translate the coded lines to a visual representation.

# Problems Encountered

> The one that gave me the most problem was probably Exercise 4. A few of us worked on this together (which is why a few codes for this exercise may look similar, as we tweaked it as a group).
> It was really frustrating as every time we had what we thought was a successful code, a new problem came up. The two main factors we faced with difficulty, was optimising the tries it took to guess each answer, and also the inconsistency in the number of tests passed. Sometimes 31/31 tests passed, but if we ran the python test a few more times, it would be like 29/31 passed, 22/31 passed etc. Eventually we got it to succeed by re-adjusting the guess using a +1 or -1 variable between each answer (or this is the best way I can explain it in English, as I don’t know enough technical terminology to explain it correctly)

# New Things Learned

- Learned how to transfer coded lines to visual representations in the form of diagrams
- Learned how to do a binary search
- Learned how to do a PR in github to submit an edit for the course docs

# Supplementary Resources

> The podcast: Galef, J. (2016). Tom Griffiths and Brian Christian on “Algorithms to Live By”. 🎧 Rationally Speaking
> I enjoyed listening to the podcast, and this point interested me a lot -
> Julia mentions: There's one other important motivational point that I want to close on, which is that I often encounter people beating themselves up because they used some algorithm and it didn't turn out well for them. Maybe the algorithm is, “I should experiment with being more open with people.” The reason the person chooses that policy or that algorithm is that they think that overall in the long run, it's going to be better for them. They're going to get better at being open. They're going to calibrate their expectations about how much openness is okay. But they try it and the second or third time they try it, the person really reacts badly to their openness, and so they're like "Dammit, I should never have done this. This was a huge mistake." They feel terrible.

(Continued) I always want to tell people "Do you think this a good policy or not? Did you get unlucky, or was the policy actually a bad policy in expectation, and not just after the fact it turned out poorly?"

> This reminded me a lot of the MBTI tests and what it said about certain personality types. Apparently some personality types can see patterns more clearly than other types. And by patterns, It doesn’t mean the visual representation of shapes in the outside world, but more of an instinctive feeling about whether something will fail or succeed, how situations will pan out, or what conclusion may be reached even if many factors are undecided. Many people call this intuition, but at the quintessential essence behind it, I think it has a lot to do with pattern recognition based on the learned environmental schema you grew up with, which in other words, could be also termed an algorithm of sorts.

# To Do:

- Find a data set for the assignment (important)
- Familiarise with Week 4’s content.

# test push
