TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

# Week 10

> A journal entry from the past few weeks combined"

- In around week 7, after trying to get the aurora data set working, there were too many fundamental problems with it - that being the complete set was locked behind a FTP server, and I couldn't get access to the complete data set, as well as many of the rows being unusable without a background in atmospheric calculations.

- I then switched to the next best thing which held similar aspects to an aurora (I guess in the sense that they are both atmospheric, and create some form of light)

- This dataset (recommended by gen after she heard I wanted to do something with atmospheric phenomena), was a record of the meteorites which fell to earth within a certain time period.

- The meteor data set was a lot more usable than the aurora data set, and many problems which I had phrasing questions or creating analysis content from which to make insights and assumptions about things, became a lot more clear with this new set.

# Update

> Finished the data set after a lot of googling, stack overflow, asking friends for advice, pain, YouTube, and external stress. big sad.

- Hopefully it's acceptable, but I guess we shall see tomorrow .-.
