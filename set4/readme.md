TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

# Problems Encountered

> Understanding how the json files work was pretty complex. Had to use external resources to understand and then apply the information.
> Also, for some reason, the first json file exercise in "def get_some_details():" had to use the inclusion of a [0] for the contents of the file to be read/extracted properly. Whereas in the other json exercise "def pokedex(low=1, high=5):", it didn't have to be used.

> Encountered an error on the last part of the exercise where it was not creating an extra file which was required, even though the code seemed to be correct. Ran over it through with Ben, and changed 2 parts which weren't part of the specific exercise which had a problem. These changes seemed to be the fix, and it was a good reminder to always look into other parts of the file which may interfere with how it runs.

# Solutions

> From my understanding, the reason why [0] had to be used, was because the first jason file had content which were in square brackets [], thus to extract the answer, a second file system had to be used besides the curly brackets {}. Whereas in the second json exercise, the answer was not within square brackets, and thus the specific answer could be done with just {}.

# Interesting things learned

> Learned a bit about NTLs (Night Time Lights), and the observations which could be made from them. I've always had an interest in lights and any luminescent thing, so reading into the data provided by NASA's satellite observation was fascinating. Had a lingering idea to use this as the data for the major project for this course, but still unsure yet.

# Supplementary Reading

> Read through Polich, K. (2015). NYC Speed Camera Analysis, and it provided me a better insight of the data set project.

> In the NYC Speed Camera Analysis, there were 2 main focus points:

1. Are the speed cameras distributed in order to maximize public safety or revenue?
2. Have the speed cameras demonstrated any relationship with pedestrian/vehicle collision reduction?

> Having a pair of concise questions which could flow into other observations was a point I noticed while reading. It seemed important to set a main hypothesis and then test it, much like a science experiment, and the more detailed and concise the question is, the more useful the answer or fact that is discovered tends to be.

> It was really interesting seeing the coding and then the visual depictions and diagrams which accompanied it. For each observation, the author set a hypothesis and then tested it with analysis from the data, which either proved true or false the initial assumption.
> This was also referenced with geo coded data, so it was really informative to see a project which contained elements which we are required to look into for our own data sets and analysis.

> The process of drawing useful and interesting information from what originally would be just a set of numbers appeared to be a complex one, and the process which Polich went through seemed fairly difficult. I am now quite apprehensive in finding a suitable data set, as I fear the data set I choose, may prove to be difficult later compared to other data sets that could have been chosen.
