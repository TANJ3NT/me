TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

# Week 9

> Journal entry:

I don't know how to describe it properly, but I can only focus on 1 assignment at a time. It's a really fundamental learning flaw that I have, but ever since young, I've only been able to do one thing at a time. Thus the dataset project has been on the backburner a tad, which I really regret.

I'm not too happy with my current data set, and I feel like I've asked a lot of questions already. Hopefully this week, I'll be able to spend a few extra nights working on the data set assignment and get it back up to speed.

# Supplementary Reading

> Been learning quite a bit from these supplementary readings. Usually I ignore them, but depending on the tutor, there's a reason why they're there.

This week I checked back on one of the readings which I missed

- Graham, P. (2009). Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule.

> I'm terrible with scheduling, so this was a read which was a lot more relatable than I expected. The article discussed the difference between a maker's schedule, and a manager's schedule, along with the difficulties encountered, should those two ever cross over and interact with each other. Fundamentally, people break up time in a certain way which makes sense to them, and to encounter a schedule system that does not make sense to you, or clashes with the one you're already comfortable with, can create less efficiency or damage the output of the person. But in another sense, I think the ability to perceive schedules from different perspectives, allows you in some sense to work with different units of time. Sure, they might not be what you would optimally choose, but you can understand the way they allot their time, and mitigate the damage created when conflicting schedules meet.
