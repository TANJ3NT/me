# Week 7

> Journal entry:

This week is what u call...

A disaster.

:')

> Power outage (everything electronic died)
> Short circuit (most electronic things died)
> Optus internet maintenance
> Lost files (due to aforementioned electronic technical difficulties)
> Corrupted files (I don't know enough tech to understand how this happened, but I'm just gonna blame the previous events as it makes me feel better hehe)

Have another pile of deliverables for 1240 and 3100 sigh.

# Supplementary Reading:

> Took a break from 1240 and 3100, and as I had too much anxiety to start the data set project in fear of encountering some disastrous problem, I caught up on another reading from a previous week.

- Victor, B. (2011). Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction.

This reading interested me quite a bit. The idea that many challenges lie on the "boundary of theory and the unknown", was something that I had come across a few times, and have heard things about, but never really read into it. The idea that there is a ladder of abstraction from which you can climb up and down to perceive and approach things from the level they should be seen, or taking a few rungs in either direction to provide a new perspective, was something I had not read directly and had the chance to visualise yet.

I really like the part where, "When designing at this boundary, the challenge lies not in constructing the system, but in understanding it. In the absence of theory, we must develop an intuition to guide our decisions."

I'm not sure if this an applicable example, but often when we are given assignments in studio for industrial design or architecture, and the brief is too vague, a lot of what is expected or required, begins to be theoretical. Multiple times, these theories are often in contention among our peers. A considerable number of times, the final deciding choice on a design decision, is mostly based on intuition which I can't explain. Sometime's the intuition is wrong, but I think more often than not, the intuition led to a successful outcome.

And as you progress and continue learning, the intuition becomes sharper. Sometimes you can't decipher it, but at other times, the real reward is when you are able to analyse the reasoning or factors which created that intuition, and apply it - not just in a sense that you feel the decision was more right or wrong, but that you are able to see the factors influencing your thought process, and can thus logically make a better decision if the situation requires such logic.
