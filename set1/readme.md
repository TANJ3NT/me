TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
test push

Learned this week:

> Everything was new, so pretty much all the content in the week 1 tutorial and guide was fresh information.  
> I realised that coding requires a different thought process from what I traditionally use, and is a sphere of thinking I feel unfamiliar and out of my depth with.
> The push and pull system with git-hub was fascinating. From my perception, it's like a mix between a cloud server and the joke about renaming files like finaldraftv1, final draftv2, FINALFINALDRAFT, USE THISv1. I think pushing and pulling information to and from my laptop to pc, as well as saving files and being able to access a log of saved changes will be useful.  
> There's a 70+hr podcast on Rome (THoR by Mike Duncan?). Might be good listen to while on the train.

Problems encountered:

> accidentally set up 2 github accounts as I made one with the wrong email. Wanted to use 1 email for all T2 coding things, thus centralised all new accounts like github, stackoverflow with a new email. This caused visual studio/github to retain the old one, and thus when pushing using 'git push', it came with an error saying I had no authorised access to the account, even though I was signed into the new one and had properly forked the 'me' repo. This was solved by typing 'git help' (which is hilarious as it sounds like get help), then either 'git reset' or 'git rebase'. This prompted a new internal sign-in which authorised my new github account on this laptop.
> Installing anaconda without ticking the 'paths' checkbox, will cause an error when certain commands are run. Solved by re-installing with 'add to path' checkbox ticked
> The workflow of the guide on https://design-computing.github.io/md/week1, was comprehensive and helpful. Our table was thankful for the effort taken to type it all up! Although I followed the guide step by step, I had trouble interpreting some of them due to errors created on my end of the machine, whether it be due to wrong inputs, or installation errors. This was solved by listening to others who had run into a similar issue, or asking the tutors for assistance.
