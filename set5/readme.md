TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

# Problems Encountered

> Attempted to do set 5, but after trying a few different ways to answer the exercise questions, the error code at the end of the test seems to indicate there either is an error in the set 5 test answers, or there isn't a test system set up yet for this particular set.

# Data Set Ideas

> Have an interest in lights, so my data set theme will probably be between:

> First Data set idea: NTLs (Night Time Lights)
> Second Data set idea: Auroras (Northern Lights) caused by solar winds
